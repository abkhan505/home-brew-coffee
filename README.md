## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, node.JS, mongoDB, Google+ OAuth

This project uses a combination of HTML, CSS and JavaScript with node.JS, mongoDB and Google+ OAuth in order to deliver a full-stack application that acts as a social media platform with the ability to create an account, upload posts with images and comments, delete posts, upload comments and interact with a like system.

## Optimizations

I have two core optimizations I would like to implement going forward as I was unable to due to time constraints. The first optimization implementation is to create a more dedicated UI to enhance the visual experience. The second is to transition this platform to React in order to better facilitate a more robust UI.

## Lessons Learned:

This project allowed me to utilize my entire full-stack skillset in order to create an application emulating a social media platform for a client.
